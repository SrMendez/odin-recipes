<p>There's only one Paella Valenciana, and it comes from Valencia.</p>
<p>Over time different kinds of rices were created by chinging diferent or all the ingredients.</p>
<p>Traditionally it was made with ten basic ingredients that people could afford. That's the <strong>authentic</strong> paella valenciana</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Rabbit</li>
        <li>Green beans <em>"Ferraura"</em></li>
        <li>Carob beans <em>"Garrof√≥"</em></li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Bottled or hard water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Saffron</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a nice amount of olive oil in the pan and level it off</li>
        <li>When it's hot add a little salt and then add the chicken and rabbit.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is browned, move it outside the paella and add the cut green and carob beans. Saute for 2-3 minutes without burning it.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoe and fry it.</li>
        <li>Pour the water until it covers the rivets on the handles and let it cook.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat and cook everything for about 5-10 minutes. Add the saffron and salt.</li>
        <li>Before adding the rice, test the salt level and if it's a little salty and the water is boiling, add the rice.</li>
        <li>There are two ways to measure the amount of rice. The first one you have to make a cross with the rice, sitcking out a finger of the broth. The second one, you will have to trust the typical measure, double and a half of water for one of rice.</li>
        <li>Leave the fire at maximum for 5 minutes and then go down to low-medium heat. Cook for about 18 minutes in total, no more or you will pass the rice.</li>
    </ol>
