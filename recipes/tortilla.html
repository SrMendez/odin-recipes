        <h2>Tortilla de Patatas Recipe</h2>
        <p>Potato omelette is one of the first recipes that every chef must know.</p>
        <p>We are going to cook a typical spanish tortilla with two special touches.</p>
        <p>We are going to cook the potatoes cold, starting with oil to obtain a confit that makes them creamier.</p>
        <p>Secondly, we are going to caramelize the onion and add it to the potatoes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients for 4 people</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes 700g</li>
            <li>Onions 300g</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We start caramelizing the onion. First, peel the onion and cut it into julienne strips.</li>
            <li>Then put it in a frying pan over a very low heat. We are interested in poaching it very slowly. The onion will caramelize on its own natural sugars.</li>
            <li>While the onion is being cooked, peel the potatoes and cut them into thin slices. Leave them in water for 15 minutes and put a pan with abundant olive oil on the fire.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and let them fry very slowly until they are candied.</li>
            <li>Remove the potatoes, drain them well and place them in a large bowl. Drain the onion aswell and put it on the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs and add them in to the bowl, stirring with a fork so that the three ingredients are well mixed.</li>
            <li>Curdle the tortilla in a pan with a tablespoon of oil for about three or four minutes and turn it over.</li>
            <li>If you are not very experienced, try turning it over with the help of a plate.</li>
        </ol>
